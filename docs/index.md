# Get help with using RStudio

Congratulations! You have decided to use the worldâ€™s most popular statistical analysis software, R! R is a free software and a very powerful tool. It can be used simply as a calculator or to analyze data sets with billions of observations. Here you will find information about getting started with R and the fancy user interface RStudio. Check out the files, tutorials, and links below to help you out.

## Installing R and RStudio.

We typically use RStudio to write and execute code since it is nicer looking. But you need to first download R in order for everything to work smoothly.

[Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)

[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## RStudio in Stat 1090

These are some of the documents I have used in my Intro Stats classes. I expect my students to be able to perform this analysis in StatCrunch through MyStatLab, but not in RStudio. I give them an introduction to statistical coding and give them some basic tools. You may still see students ask about these techniques.

1. [Basic R Code](BasicRcode.pdf)
2. [Using R with the Normal Distribution](Rnormal.pdf)
3. [Survey Data](responses.csv)

## Tutorials

These are some tutorials that I have created for my more advanced classes. Feel free to look them over if you would like more technical information about R and RStudio.

## More Tutorials and Help

I highly reccomend trying the [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) tutorial in RStudio to get hands-on practice.
Also, consider Googling "How to _________ in R". There are tons of resources online with examples of code.
